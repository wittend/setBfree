setBfree
========

A DSP Tonewheel Organ emulator.

setBfree is a MIDI-controlled, software synthesizer designed to imitate the
sound and properties of the electromechanical organs and sound modification
devices that brought world-wide fame to the names and products of Laurens
Hammond and Don Leslie.

Quick-start
-----------

 - start jackd (see http://jackaudio.org, more below)
 - run `setBfreeUI` for the GUI version
 - run `setBfree` for the headless commandline application
 - or load the LV2 plugin "setBfree DSP Tonewheel Organ" in your favorite DAW

Usage
-----

Run `setBfree -h` for a quick overview. `setBfree --help` will output a
lengthy list of available options and properties than can be modified.

`setBfree` is the synthesizer engine. It responds to MIDI messages (JACK-MIDI
or ALSA-sequencer) and outputs audio to JACK. The engine does not have any
graphical user interface (GUI). It is usually started from the commandline.

The GUI `setBfreeUI` is a standalone application that wraps the LV2 plugin.
It provides both visual feedback about the current synth state as well as allows
to reconfigure and control numerous aspects of the organ.

The organ itself, as well as broken out parts (leslie, reverv, overdrive) are
available as LV2 plugins.

Examples:

	setBfree jack.out.left="system:playback_7" jack.out.left="system:playback_8"
	setBfreeUI
	jalv.gtk http://gareus.org/oss/lv2/b_synth # LV2 in jalv-host


Getting started - standalone app
--------------------------------

You'll want reliable, low-latency, real-time audio. Therefore you want
[JACK](http://jackaudio.org/). On GNU/Linux we recommend `qjackctl` to start the
jack-audio-server, on OSX jack comes with a GUI called JACK-pilot. On Windows use the
Jack Control GUI.

An excellent tutorial to get started with JACK can be found on the
[libremusicproduction](http://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack)
website.

Render diagram with http://ditaa.org/
A pre-rendered image is available in the doc/ folder.

Each of the stages - except the synth-engine itself - can be bypassed. The
effects are available as standalone LV2 plugins which provides for creating
custom effect chains and use 3rd party effects.

The preamp/overdrive is disabled by default, reverb is set to 30% (unless
overridden with `reverb.mix`, `reverb.dry` or `reverb.wet`). Note that a
stopped leslie will still modify the sound (horn-speaker characteristics,
angle-dependent reflections). Bypassing the leslie (`whirl.bypass=1`) will mute
the drum-output signals and simply copy the incoming audio-signal to the horn
L/R outputs. The cabinet-emulation is an experimental convolution engine and
bypassed by default.

The LV2-synth includes the first three effects until and including the Leslie.
The effects can be triggered via MIDI just as with the standalone JACK
application. The cabinet-emulation is not included in the LV2-synth because it
depends on impulse-response files which are not shipped with the plugin.

The Vibrato and Chorus effects are built into the synth-engine itself, as are
key-click and percussion modes. These features are linked to the tone
generation itself and can not be broken-out to standalone effects.

Summary of Changes since Beatrix
--------------------------------

*   native JACK application (JACK Audio, JACK MIDI)
*   synth engine: variable sample-rate, floating point (beatrix is 22050 Hz, 16bit only)
*   broken-out effects as LV2 plugins; LV2 wrapper around synth-engine
*   built-in documentation
*   Graphical User Interface, with MIDI-feedback and dynamically bound MIDI-CC
*   state save/restore
*   numerous bug fixes

see the ChangeLog and git log for details.


Compile
-------

Install the dependencies and simply call `make` followed by `sudo make install`.

*   libjack-dev - **required** - [JACK](http://jackaudio.org/) is used for audio and MIDI I/O
*   libftgl-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev, ttf-bitstream-vera - optional, **recommended** - openGL GUI
*   lv2-dev - optional, **recommended** - [LV2](http://lv2plug.in/) plugins and GUI
*   libzita-convolver-dev - optional - [libzita-convolver](http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/downloads/index.html) is used for cabinet-emulation
*   libsndfile1-dev - optional - [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) is needed to load IR samples for zita-convolver
*   liblo-dev - optional - [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) used only in standalone preamp/overdrive app.
*   libasound2-dev - optional - ALSA MIDI
*   help2man - optional - re-create the man pages
*   doxygen - optional - create source-code annotations


If zita-convolver and libsndfile1-dev are available one can use

	make clean
	make ENABLE_CONVOLUTION=yes

to enable additional leslie cabinet simulation.
This is an additional optional post-processing step and not related to the 
leslie doppler and built-in angular-dependent leslie speaker emulation.

As for version 0.8, alsa-sequencer support is deprecated and no longer enabled by
default (even if libasound is found), It is still available via `ENABLE_ALSA=yes`.

The Makefile understands PREFIX and DESTDIR variables: e.g.

	make clean
	make ENABLE_CONVOLUTION=yes PREFIX=/usr ENABLE_ALSA=yes
	make install ENABLE_CONVOLUTION=yes ENABLE_ALSA=yes PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=mypackage/setbfree/

**Packagers**: see debian/rules in the git-repository. LDFLAGS can be passed as is,
CFLAGS should be specified by overriding the OPTIMIZATIONS variable.
The packaging also includes a desktop-file to launch setBfree from the
application-menu which is not included in the release.
